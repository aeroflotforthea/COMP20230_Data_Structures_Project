# Considerations



## Ideas

- using a graph
  - paths need to made including all cities
  - 
- Sorting the scores and taking the lowest
- 



1. Create graph with all the nodes, making sure that each path between nodes is possible and valid
   1. first and last must be the same, for a specified city, max-distance is the range of the aeroplane, so if the distance from one point to another is greater than that, you don't include that path
   2. Checking the range of the plane continuously 
2. Iterate over each path calculating its score
   1. Getting the exchange rate from each airport
3. Sort scores and choose the lowest
